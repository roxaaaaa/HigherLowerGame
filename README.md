# HigherLowerGame

implementation of a card game called HighLow.

The rules for playing a HighLow game are as follows:
The dealer (computer) will deal a card face up. The player must
decide whether the next card to be dealt will be higher or
lower in value to the face-up card. If the player guesses
correctly, the player wins otherwise the player loses (the dealer
wins). The next round then commences.
This is repeated for 5 rounds. Best out of 5 is the winner.
